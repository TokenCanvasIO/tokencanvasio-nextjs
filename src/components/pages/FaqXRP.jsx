      <PolicySection title="What are AMM Pools?">
        <p>
          AMM (Automated Market Maker) Pools are decentralized liquidity pools on the XRP Ledger that allow users to trade tokens without traditional order books. They provide liquidity for token pairs and enable instant swaps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our platform displays AMM pools with real-time data including:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Total Liquidity:</strong> The combined value locked in the pool</li>
          <li><strong>APY (Annual Percentage Yield):</strong> Estimated returns for liquidity providers</li>
          <li><strong>24h Volume:</strong> Trading activity over the last day</li>
        </ul>
      </PolicySection>

      {/* âœ… NEW SECTION */}
      <PolicySection title="Why aren't all AMM pools shown?">
        <p>
          We source AMM pool data from <strong>XPMarket.com</strong>, which aggregates and ranks pools by liquidity and trading volume. Only pools with sufficient activity and liquidity are included in their rankings.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you can't find a specific AMM pool on our platform, it may be because:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-2">
          <li>The pool has very low liquidity (under a certain threshold)</li>
          <li>The pool is newly created and hasn't been indexed yet</li>
          <li>The pool has minimal trading volume and isn't tracked by XPMarket</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To create your own AMM pool or view all pools directly, visit <a href="https://xpmarket.com/amm/top" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-500 hover:underline font-semibold">XPMarket.com</a>.

      <PolicySection title="Why did the bubbles stop moving?">
        <p>
          To conserve resources, the physics engine will "go to sleep" after a period of inactivity. You can wake them up by clicking the <strong>Restart Simulation</strong> button (ðŸ”„) in the floating control bar.
        </p>
      </PolicySection>

      <PolicySection title="Why is my NFT image missing?">
        <p>
          When you add a new NFT, its data is fetched in the background. Sometimes, your browser may load the bubble before this is complete. A simple page refresh or using the <strong>Restart Simulation</strong> button (ðŸ”„) will typically solve the problem.
