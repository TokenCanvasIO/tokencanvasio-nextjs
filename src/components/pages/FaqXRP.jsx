      <PolicySection title="Why did the bubbles stop moving?">
        <p>
          To conserve resources, the physics engine will "go to sleep" after a period of inactivity. You can wake them up by clicking the <strong>Restart Simulation</strong> button (ðŸ”„) in the floating control bar.
        </p>
      </PolicySection>
      
      <PolicySection title="Why is my NFT image missing?">
        <p>
          When you add a new NFT, its data is fetched in the background. Sometimes, your browser may load the bubble before this is complete. A simple page refresh or using the <strong>Restart Simulation</strong> button (ðŸ”„) will typically solve the problem.
